## The Problem
*I am a book maniac... In a month I’ve read more than four books, but I'm losing track of how many books I have read and how many books I still haven’t. I need a place to store all the information on the books I own, considering those I have read and those I haven’t. It has to have a checkbox in order for me to check those I have already gone through; and it also has to generate an annual report of how many books I’ve read per month, their titles and details about each book.*
